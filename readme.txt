INSTALLATION

Copy SVJour.cls and svglobal.clo to a place where LaTeX can find them
(usually a directory of the TEXINPUT path).


GETTING STARTED

You should first read the "Main User's Guide" to get an overview
and then the "User's Guide for the Global Class Option" for startup
instructions. Alternatively to reading the entire documentation, it is
also possible to proceed by merely filling out the template and then
looking up additional commands as needed.
